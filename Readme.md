# Golang Data structure Visualization
Fast visualize data structures in Golang with interactive screens

# Disclosure
Godsvisus is heavily based on [Fyne](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne), which makes it unusable when taking into account unit tests.
Because fyne app only runs on main goroutine, Godsvisus only supports visualizations of slices & linked lists in main goroutine. As a matter of fact, it will be suspended & alternatives solution will be seek to replace Fyne.
